NWFramework provide a base code to build any professional video application. Originally developed to support the internal apps development at InCrew Software, we like to make it public to be used on Open Source projects.

We found a lack of complete frameworks that will cover all the needs in this kind of applications:
**GUI** Comms
**Client / Server Architecture** Threading
**Etc**

The framework support all the needs from GUI to low level thread management. You can develop application that will work on Windows and the Front End on OS X or vice-versa.

You can have the GUI working on the same machine or on a distant machines, the framework support it.

Currently Support Windows XP/2003 and Vista.

We're updating the internal OS X version to be ready as GPL  too very soon.
